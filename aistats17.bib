Here, we define clustering error in a  discriminative fashion, demonstrating fundamental connections between classification (supervised) and clustering (unsupervised). For both classification and clustering, our lower bounds show that without enough samples, the best any classifier or clustering rule can do is close to random guessing. For classification, as part of our upper bound analysis,  we show that Fisher's linear discriminant achieves a fast minimax rate Theta(1/n) with enough samples n. For clustering, as part of our upper bound analysis, we show that a clustering rule constructed using principal component analysis achieves the minimax rate with enough samples. We also provide lower and upper bounds for the high-dimensional sparse  setting where the dimensionality of the covariates p is potentially larger than the number of samples n, but where the difference between the Gaussian means is sparse. },

	 abstract = {Learning a computationally efficient kernel from data is an important machine learning problem. The majority of kernels in the literature do not leverage the geometry of the data, and those that do are computationally infeasible for contemporary datasets. Recent advances in approximation techniques have expanded the applicability of the kernel methodology to scale linearly with the data size. Data-dependent kernels, which could leverage this computational advantage, have however not yet seen the benefit. Here we derive an approximate large-scale learning procedure for data-dependent kernels that is efficient and performs well in practice. We provide a Lemma that can be used to derive the asymptotic convergence of the approximation in the limit of infinite random features, and, under certain conditions, an estimate of the convergence speed. We empirically prove that our construction represents a valid, yet efficient approximation of the data-dependent kernel. For large-scale datasets of millions of datapoints, where the proposed method is now applicable for the first time, we notice a significant performance boost over both baselines consisting of data independent kernels and of kernel approximations, at comparable computational cost.},

	 pages = {28 - 36},
	 abstract = {Utilizing expert input often improves clustering performance.   However in a knowledge discovery problem, ground truth is unknown even to an expert.   Thus, instead of one expert, we solicit the opinion from multiple experts. The key question motivating this work is: which experts should be assigned higher weights when  there is disagreement on whether to put a pair of samples in the same group? To model the uncertainty in constraints from different experts, we build a probabilistic model for  pairwise constraints through jointly modeling each expert's accuracy and the mapping from features to latent cluster assignments.  After learning our probabilistic discriminative clustering model and accuracies of different experts, 1) samples that were not annotated by any expert can be clustered using the discriminative clustering model; and  2) experts with higher accuracies are automatically assigned higher weights in determining the  latent cluster assignments. Experimental results on UCI benchmark datasets and a real-world disease subtyping dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms competing alternatives, including semi-crowdsourced clustering,  semi-supervised clustering with constraints from majority voting,   and consensus clustering.},

Our analysis is based on Fano's inequality, along with novel mutual information bounds for the active learning setting, and the application of restricted graph ensembles.  While we consider ensembles that are similar or identical to those used in the passive setting, we require different analysis techniques, with a key challenge being bounding a mutual information quantity associated with observed subsets of nodes, as opposed to full observations.},

	 abstract = {Despite the empirical success of deep neural networks, there is limited theoretical understanding on the learnability of these models using a polynomial-time algorithm. In this paper, we characterize the learnability of fully-connected neural networks via both positive and negative results. We focus on $\ell_1$-regularized networks, where the $\ell_1$-norm of the incoming weights of every neuron is assumed to be bounded by a constant $B > 0$. Our first result shows that such networks are properly learnable in $poly(n,d,\exp(1/\epsilon^2))$ time, where $n$ and $d$ are the sample size and the input dimension, and $\epsilon > 0$ is the gap to optimality. The bound is achieved by repeatedly sampling over a low-dimensional manifold so as to ensure approximate optimality, but avoids the $\exp(d)$ cost of exhaustively searching over the parameter space. We also establish a hardness result showing that the exponential dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is unavoidable unless \mbox{${\bf RP} = {\bf NP}$.}  Our second result shows that the exponential dependence on $1/\epsilon$ can be avoided by exploiting the underlying structure of the data distribution. In particular, if the positive and negative examples can be separated with margin $\gamma > 0$ by an unknown neural network, then the network can be learned in $poly(n,d,1/\epsilon)$ time. The bound is achieved by an ensemble method which uses the first algorithm as a weak learner. We further show that the separability assumption can be weakened to tolerate noisy labels. Finally, we show that the exponential dependence on $1/\gamma$ is unimprovable under a certain cryptographic assumption.},

	 author = {Alabdulmohsin, Ibrahim},
	 pages = {92 - 100},
	 abstract = {One fundamental goal in any learning algorithm is to mitigate its risk for overfitting. Mathematically, this requires that the learning algorithm enjoys a small generalization risk, which is defined either in expectation or in probability. Both types of generalization are commonly used in the literature. For instance, generalization in expectation has been used to analyze algorithms, such as ridge regression and SGD, whereas generalization in probability is used in the VC theory, among others. Recently, a third notion of generalization has been studied, called uniform generalization, which requires that the generalization risk vanishes uniformly in expectation across all bounded parametric losses. It has been shown that uniform generalization is, in fact, equivalent to an information-theoretic stability constraint, and that it recovers classical results in learning theory. It is achievable under various settings, such as sample compression schemes, finite hypothesis spaces, finite domains, and differential privacy. However, the relationship between uniform generalization and concentration remained unknown. In this paper, we answer this question by proving that, while a generalization in expectation does not imply a generalization in probability, a uniform generalization in expectation does imply concentration. We establish a chain rule for the uniform generalization risk of the composition of hypotheses and use it to derive a large deviation bound. Finally, we prove that the bound is tight.},

On the lower bound side, we obtain a novel complexity term to measure the sample complexity that every Best-k-Arm instance requires. This is derived by an interesting and nontrivial reduction from the Best-1-Arm problem. We also provide an elimination-based algorithm that matches the instance-wise lower bound within doubly-logarithmic factors. The sample complexity of our algorithm strictly dominates the state-of-the-art for Best-k-Arm (module constant factors).},

Submodular continuous functions naturally find applications in various real-world settings, including influence and revenue maximization with continuous assignments, sensor energy management, facility location, etc.  Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms efficiently generate superior solutions  compared to baseline algorithms.},

In this work, we introduce an auxiliary variable MCMC scheme that samples from an annular augmented space, translating to a great circle path around the hypercube of the binary sample space.  This annular augmentation sampler explores the sample space more effectively than coordinate-wise samplers and has no tunable parameters, leading to substantial performance gains in estimating quantities of interest in large binary models.  We extend the method to incorporate into the sampler any existing mean-field approximation (such as from belief propagation), leading to further performance improvements.  Empirically, we consider a range of large Ising models and an application to risk factors for heart disease.},

Such temporally imprecise labels commonly occur in areas like mobile health research where human annotators are tasked with labeling the occurrence of very short duration events. We propose a general learning framework for this problem that can accommodate different base classifiers and noise models.

	 abstract = {Decision makers, such as doctors and judges, make crucial decisions such as recommending treatments to patients, and granting bails to defendants on a daily basis. Such decisions typically involve weighting the potential benefits of taking an action against the costs involved.  In this work, we aim to automate this task of learning cost-effective, interpretable and actionable treatment regimes. We formulate this as a problem of learning a decision list -- a sequence of if-then-else rules -- which maps characteristics of subjects (eg., diagnostic test results of patients) to treatments. We propose a novel objective to construct a decision list which maximizes outcomes for the population, and minimizes overall costs. Since we do not observe the outcomes corresponding to counterfactual scenarios, we use techniques from causal inference literature to infer them. We model the problem of learning the decision list as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a variant of the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy which leverages customized checks for pruning the search space effectively.  Experimental results on real world observational data capturing judicial bail decisions and treatment recommendations for asthma patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

We leverage on the structure of the problem to show how the regret is related to the sensitivity (i.e., the gradient) of the objective function and how selecting optimal arms associated to \textit{optimistic} parameters does control it. Thus we show that TS can be seen as a generic randomized algorithm where the sampling distribution is designed to have a fixed probability of being optimistic, at the cost of an additional $\sqrt{d}$ regret factor compared to a UCB-like approach. Furthermore, we show that our proof can be readily applied to regularized linear optimization and generalized linear model problems.},

	 abstract = {Estimation of \emph{density ridges} has been gathering a great deal of attention since it enables us to reveal lower-dimensional structures hidden in data. Recently, \emph{subspace constrained mean shift} (SCMS) was proposed as a practical algorithm for density ridge estimation. A key technical ingredient in SCMS is to accurately estimate the ratios of the density derivatives to the density. SCMS takes a three-step approach for this purpose --- first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density derivative estimator and division by an estimated density could significantly magnify the estimation error. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method that directly estimates the ratios without going through density estimation and division. Our proposed estimator has an analytic-form solution and it can be computed efficiently. We further establish a non-parametric convergence bound for the proposed ratio estimator. Finally, based on this direct ratio estimator, we develop a practical algorithm for density ridge estimation and experimentally demonstrate its usefulness on a variety of datasets.},

In contrast to prior work, we focus on the challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can be conditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under such assumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximize the reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly.  We propose ECED, a novel, efficient active learning algorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated, noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at each step, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective, which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies on an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the approximation bound. We demonstrate strong empirical performance of ECED on two problem instances, including a Bayesian experimental design task intended to distinguish among economic theories of how people make risky decisions, and an active preference learning task via pairwise comparisons.},

In this paper, we introduce a new definition of $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in MGs which grasps the strategy's quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing the norm of two Bellman-like residuals implies to learn such an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the $L_p$ norm of these Bellman-like residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting.

Through a simple convex program, our proposed estimator finds an extreme point of the intersection of these slabs that is best aligned with a given anchor vector. We characterize geometric conditions that certify success of the proposed estimator. Furthermore, using classic results in statistical learning theory, we show that for random measurements the geometric certificates hold with high probability at an optimal sample complexity.

However, we prove that the representer theorem does hold in an appropriately transformed RKHS, guaranteeing that the optimization of the penalized likelihood can be cast as a tractable finite-dimensional problem.  The resulting approach is simple to implement, and readily scales to high dimensions and large-scale datasets. },

Our proof assumes the existence of accurate estimates of the diagonal entries of the underlying inverse covariance matrix; we additionally provide a two-step method to obtain these estimates, even in a high-dimensional setting, going beyond the proofs for related methods.  Unlike other pseudolikelihood-based methods, we also show that PseudoNet does not saturate, i.e., in high dimensions, there is no hard limit on the number of nonzero entries in the PseudoNet estimate.  We present a fast algorithm as well as screening rules that make computing the PseudoNet estimate over a range of tuning parameters tractable.},

Phase transitions, which are also known as degeneracy in the network science literature, are an emergent property of these models that well describe many physical systems. However, the reach of the Gibbs measure is now far outside the realm of physical systems, and in many of these domains multiphase behavior is a nuisance. This nuisance often makes distribution fitting impossible due to failure of the MCMC sampler, and even when an MLE fit is possible, if the solution is near a phase transition point, the plausibility of the fit can be highly questionable. We introduce a modification to the Gibbs distribution that reduces the effects of phase transitions, and with properly chosen hyper-parameters, provably removes all multiphase behavior. We show that this new distribution is just as easy to fit via MCMCMLE as the Gibbs measure, and provide examples in the Ising model from statistical physics and ERGMs from network science.},

As a result, it is increasingly common for researchers to treat linkage as a clustering task, in which each latent entity is associated with one or more noisy database records. We critically assess performance bounds  using the  Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under a Bayesian record linkage framework, making connections to Kolchin partition models. We provide an upper bound using the KL divergence and a lower bound on the minimum probability of misclassifying a latent entity. We give insights for when our bounds hold using simulated data and provide practical user guidance. },

In each step, SS prunes a $1-1/\sqrt{c}$ (for $c>1$) fraction of the nodes using weights on edges computed based on only a small number ($O(\log n)$) of randomly sampled nodes. The algorithm requires $\log_{\sqrt{c}}n$ steps with a small and highly parallelizable per-step computation. An accuracy-speed tradeoff parameter $c$, set as $c = 8$, leads to a fast shrink rate $\sqrt{2}/4$ and small iteration complexity $\log_{2\sqrt{2}}n$. Analysis shows that w.h.p., the greedy algorithm on the pruned set of size $O(\log^2 n)$ can achieve a guarantee similar to that of processing the original dataset. In news and video summarization tasks, SS is able to substantially reduce both computational costs and memory usage, while maintaining (or even slightly exceeding) the quality of the original (and much more costly) greedy algorithm.},

The local models are interpretable in terms of similarity of their sparsity patterns. The cost function is convex, and thus has a globally optimal solution.

We show that if the principal components are in general position and the errors are sufficiently sparse, R2PCA will exactly recover the principal components with probability 1, in lieu of assumptions on coherence or the distribution of the sparse errors, and even under adversarial settings. R2PCA enjoys many advantages: it works well under noise, its computational complexity scales linearly in the ambient dimension, it is easily parallelizable, and due to its low sample complexity, it can be used in settings where data is so large it cannot even be stored in memory. We complement our theoretical findings with synthetic and real data experiments showing that r2pca outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a broad range of settings.},

Optimization of the ELBO is fully parallelizable over sequences and amenable to stochastic optimization, which we use along with control variate techniques to make our framework useful in practice.

This reveals their motivation and aptness as structural priors formulated by embedding the effect in a particular functional space. This also gives rise to a range of new, kernel-based matching estimators that arise when one embeds the effect in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Depending on the case, these estimators can be found using either quadratic optimization or integer optimization. We show that estimators based on universal kernels are universally consistent without model specification. In empirical results using both synthetic and real data, the new, kernel-based estimators outperform all standard causal estimators in estimation error.},

With the growth of large-scale datasets, the computational cost associated with simulating these stochastic processes can be considerable, and many algorithms have been proposed to approximate the underlying Markov chain or diffusion. A fundamental question is how the computational savings trade off against the statistical error incurred due to approximations. This paper develops general results that address this question. We bound the Wasserstein distance between the equilibrium distributions of two diffusions as a function of their mixing rates and the deviation in their drifts. We show that this error bound is tight in simple Gaussian settings. Our general result on continuous diffusions can be discretized to provide insights into the computational--statistical trade-off of Markov chains. As an illustration, we apply our framework to derive finite-sample error bounds of approximate unadjusted Langevin dynamics. We characterize computation-constrained settings where, by using fast-to-compute approximate gradients in the Langevin dynamics, we obtain more accurate samples compared to using the exact gradients. Finally, as an additional application of our approach, we quantify the accuracy of approximate zig-zag sampling. Our theoretical analyses are supported by simulation experiments. },

We show that these heuristics can be understood, and rigorously analyzed, as approximators to the Bayes optimal classifier for a simple probabilistic model of the edge labels. We then show that the maximum likelihood estimator for this model approximately corresponds to the predictions of a Label Propagation algorithm run on a transformed version of the original social graph. Extensive experiments on a number of real-world datasets show that this algorithm is competitive against state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of both accuracy and scalability.

Given a PSD matrix M and a PSD starting point $U_0$, we show that gradient descent with appropriately chosen step-size finds an epsilon-accurate squareroot of M in $O(\alpha\log(||M-U_0||_F^2 / \epsilon))$ iterations, where $\alpha =  (\max\{||U_0||^2, ||M||\} / \min\{\sigma_{min}^2(U_0), \sigma_{min}(M)\} )^{3/2}$.

For many distributions of interest (such as the gamma or Dirichlet), simulation of random variables relies on acceptance-rejection sampling. The discontinuity introduced by the accept-reject step means that standard reparameterization tricks are not applicable. We propose a new method that lets us leverage reparameterization gradients even when variables are outputs of a acceptance-rejection sampling algorithm.

In our model, there are $L$ observed contexts and $K$ arms of the bandit. The observed context influences the reward obtained through a latent confounder variable with cardinality $m$ ($m \ll L,K$). The arm choice and the latent confounder causally determines the reward while the observed context is correlated with the confounder. Under this model, the $L \times K$ mean reward matrix $\mathbf{U}$ (for each context in $[L]$ and each arm in $[K]$) factorizes into non-negative factors $\mathbf{A}$ ($L \times m$) and  $\mathbf{W}$ ($m \times K$). This insight enables us to propose an $\epsilon$-greedy NMF-Bandit algorithm that designs a sequence of interventions (selecting specific arms), that achieves a balance between learning this low-dimensional structure and selecting the best arm to minimize regret. Our algorithm achieves a regret of  $\mathcal{O}\left(L\mathrm{poly}(m, \log K) \log T \right)$ at time $T$, as compared to $\mathcal{O}(LK\log T)$ for conventional contextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest for each context. These guarantees are obtained under mild sufficiency conditions on the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known Statistical RIP condition.  We further propose a class of generative models that satisfy our sufficient conditions, and derive a lower bound of $\mathcal{O}\left(Km\log T\right)$.  These are the first regret guarantees for online matrix completion with bandit feedback, when the rank is greater than one.

Although the idea of combining the two extensions is rather straightforward, directly estimating the density gradient on Riemannian manifolds is mathematically challenging. We will provide a mathematically sound algorithm and demonstrate its usefulness through experiments.},

In this work, we present a new Local Perturb-and-MAP (locPMAP) framework that replaces the global optimization with a local optimization by exploiting our observed connection between locPMAP and the pseudolikelihood of the original CRF model. We test our approach on three different vision tasks and show that our method achieves consistently improved performance over other approximate inference techniques optimized to a pseudolikelihood objective.  Additionally, we demonstrate that we can integrate our method in the fully convolutional network framework to increase our model's complexity. Finally, our observed connection between locPMAP and the pseudolikelihood leads to a novel perspective for understanding and using pseudolikelihood. },

Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier.  In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer class of calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior to logistic calibration for Naive Bayes and Adaboost.  },

However, it is challenging to estimate such cross-predictability among time series in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of time series is much larger than the length of each time series. We address this challenge with a sparsity assumption: only time series in the same cluster have significant cross-predictability with each other.  We demonstrate that this approach is computationally attractive, and  provide a theoretical proof that the proposed algorithm will identify the correct clustering structure with high probability under certain conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical high-dimensional time series clustering algorithm with a provable guarantee.  We evaluate with experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data, and results indicate that our method can achieve more than 80\% clustering accuracy on real-world data, which is 20\% higher than the state-of-art baselines.},

In particular, one can use both a cheap low fidelity function (e.g. a computational experiment with a CFD code) and an expensive high fidelity function (e.g. a wind tunnel experiment) to generate a data sample in order to construct a regression model of a high fidelity function. The key question in this setting is how the sizes of the high and low fidelity data samples should be selected in order to stay within a given computational budget and maximize accuracy of the regression model prior to committing resources on data acquisition.   In this paper we obtain minimax interpolation errors for single and variable fidelity scenarios for a multivariate Gaussian process regression. Evaluation of the minimax errors allows us to identify cases when the variable fidelity data provides better interpolation accuracy than the exclusively high fidelity data for the same computational budget. These results allow us to calculate the optimal shares of variable fidelity data samples under the given computational budget constraint. Real and synthetic data experiments suggest that using the obtained optimal shares often outperforms natural heuristics in terms of the regression accuracy. },

Despite its effectiveness, the existing GOB model can only be applied to small problems due to its quadratic time-dependence on the number of nodes. Existing solutions to combat the scalability issue require an often-unrealistic  clustering assumption. By exploiting a connection to Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), we show that the GOB model can be made to scale to much larger graphs without additional assumptions. In addition, we propose a Thompson sampling algorithm which uses the recent GMRF sampling-by-perturbation technique, allowing it to scale to even larger problems (leading to a ``horde'' of bandits). We give regret bounds and experimental results for GOB with Thompson sampling and epoch-greedy algorithms, indicating that these methods are as good as or significantly better than ignoring the graph or adopting a clustering-based approach. Finally, when an existing graph is not available, we propose a heuristic for learning it on the fly and show promising results. },

However, there are two unsolved issues. Theoretically, since both Laplacian matrices are positive semi-definite and the corresponding pencil is singular, it is not proven whether the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient exists and is equivalent to an eigenproblem. Computationally, the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method is not designed for solving the eigenproblem of a singular pencil.

We formulate the problem of learning these functions as a constrained variational maximum likelihood estimation problem with total variation penalty and show that the optimal solution is a 0th order spline (a piecewise constant function) with a finite number of adaptively chosen knots. This allows the inference problem to be solved efficiently and at scale by solving a finite dimensional optimization problem.

However, exact algorithms for learning and prediction are prohibitive to be applied to large datasets due to inherent computational complexity. To overcome this main limitation, various techniques have been proposed, and in particular, local GP algorithms that scales ``truly linearly''  with respect to the dataset size. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical model based on local GP for large-scale datasets, which stacks inducing points over inducing points in layers. By using different kernels in each layer, the overall model becomes multi-scale and is able to capture both long- and short-range dependencies.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by speed-accuracy performance on challenging real-world datasets.},

	 abstract = {Modern retrieval systems are often driven by an underlying machine learning model. The goal of such systems is to identify and possibly rank the few most relevant items for a given query or context. Thus, such systems are typically evaluated using a ranking-based performance metric such as the area under the precision-recall curve, the F score, precision at fixed recall, etc. Obviously, it is desirable to train such systems to optimize the metric of interest.  In practice, due to the scalability limitations of existing approaches for optimizing such objectives, large-scale retrieval systems are instead trained to maximize classification accuracy, in the hope that performance as measured via the true objective will also be favorable. In this work we present a unified framework that, using straightforward building block bounds, allows for highly scalable optimization of a wide range of ranking-based objectives. We demonstrate the advantage of our approach on several real-life retrieval problems that are significantly larger than those considered in the literature, while achieving substantial improvement in performance over the accuracy-objective baseline. },

However, the high variance caused by naive subsampling usually slows down the convergence to the desired posterior distribution. In this paper, we propose an effective subsampling strategy to reduce the variance based on a failed attempt to do importance sampling. In particular, before sampling,  we partition the dataset with k-means clustering algorithm in a preprocessing step and use the fixed clustering throughout the entire MCMC simulation.  Then during simulation, we approximate the gradient of log-posterior via summing the estimated gradient of each cluster.  The resulting procedure is surprisingly simple without enhancing the complexity of the original algorithm during sampling procedure. We apply our Clustering-based Preprocessing strategy on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, stochastic gradient Hamilton Monte Carlo and stochastic gradient Riemann Langevin dynamics. Empirically, we provide thorough numerical results to back up the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

We are concerned with data structures and algorithms to find nearest neighbors based on such comparisons. We focus on a simple yet effective algorithm that recursively splits the space by first selecting two random pivot points and then assigning all other points to the closer of the two (comparison tree). We prove that if the metric space satisfies certain expansion conditions, then with high probability the height of the comparison tree is logarithmic in the number of points, leading to efficient search performance. We also provide an upper bound for the failure  probability to return the true nearest neighbor. Experiments show that the comparison tree is competitive with algorithms that have access to the actual distance values, and needs less triplet comparisons than other competitors.},

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation Variational Inference (CVI) which brings the best of the two worlds together -- it uses conjugate computations for the conjugate terms and employs stochastic gradients for the rest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method in the mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a variational inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm's applicability to a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our experimental results show that our method converges much faster than the methods that ignore the conjugate structure of the model. },

This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly -- in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time -- from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

	 abstract = {The failure of LASSO   to identify groups of correlated predictors in linear  regression  has sparked significant research interest. Recently,   various norms were proposed, which can be  best described as instances of ordered weighted $\ell_1$ norms (OWL), as an alternative to $\ell_1$ regularization used in LASSO. OWL can identify groups of correlated variables but  it forces the model to be constant within a group.  This artifact induces unnecessary bias in the model estimation.  In this paper we take a submodular perspective and show that  OWL can be posed as the Lov\'asz extension of a suitably defined submodular function. The submodular perspective not only explains the group-wise constant behavior of OWL, but also suggests alternatives. The main contribution of this paper is smoothed OWL (SOWL), a new family of norms, which  not only identifies the groups but also allows the model to be flexible inside a group.   We establish several algorithmic and theoretical properties of SOWL including group identification and model consistency. We also provide algorithmic tools to compute the SOWL norm and its proximal operator, whose computational complexity  $O(d\log d)$ is significantly better than that of general purpose solvers in $O(d^2\log d)$. In our experiments, SOWL compares favorably with respect to OWL in the regimes of interest.},

We present a relaxation of this combinatorial problem that uses a column generation formulation where the pricing problem is solved via dynamic programming to efficiently explore the space of tracks.  We employ row generation to tighten the bound in such a way as to preserve efficient inference in the pricing problem.  We show the practical utility of this algorithm for pedestrian and particle tracking.},

In this work, we present a matrix-based implementation of belief propagation algorithms on CRBMs, which is easily scalable to tens of thousands of visible and hidden units.  We demonstrate that, in both maximum likelihood and max-margin learning, training conditional RBMs with BP as the inference routine can provide significantly better results than current state-of-the-art CD methods on structured prediction problems.

(2) We choose a proximal algorithm to optimize FASJEM. This improves the computational efficiency from $O(Kp^3)$ to $O(Kp^2)$ and reduces the memory requirement from $O(Kp^2)$ to $O(K)$.

This approach can be beneficial with regard to both computation (yielding a smaller least squares problem) and statistical performance (reducing the estimation error). We will argue below that the outcome of previous analysis of the procedure is not meaningful in typical situations, yielding a bound on the prediction error that is inferior to ordinary least squares while requiring the dimension of the projected data to be of the same order as the original dimension.

Lying in the center of the problem is the difficulty of analyzing the non-convex loss function with potentially numerous local minima and saddle points. Can neural networks corresponding to the stationary points of the loss function learn the true target function? If yes, what are the key factors contributing to such nice optimization properties?   In this paper, we answer these questions by analyzing one-hidden-layer neural networks with ReLU activation, and show that despite the non-convexity, neural networks with diverse units have no spurious local minima. We bypass the non-convexity issue by directly analyzing the first order optimality condition, and show that the loss can be made arbitrarily small if the minimum singular value of the ``extended feature matrix'' is large enough. We make novel use of techniques from kernel methods and geometric discrepancy, and identify a new relation linking the smallest singular value to the spectrum of a kernel function associated with the activation function and to the diversity of the units. Our results also suggest a novel regularization function to promote unit diversity for potentially better generalization ability.},

In particular the mass matrix of HMC is hard to tune well. In order to alleviate these problems we propose relativistic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a version of HMC based on relativistic dynamics that introduces a maximum velocity on particles. We also derive stochastic gradient versions of the algorithm and show that the resulting algorithms bear interesting relationships to gradient clipping, RMSprop, Adagrad and Adam, popular optimisation methods in deep learning. Based on this, we develop relativistic stochastic gradient descent by taking the zero-temperature limit of relativistic stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

In the prediction phase, we first hash the query into a binary code and then do the k-NN classification using the binary prototypes as the database. Our approach speeds up k-NN classification in two aspects. First, we compress the database into a smaller set of prototypes such that k-NN search only goes through a smaller set rather than the whole dataset. Second, we reduce the original space to a compact binary embedding, where the Hamming distance between two binary codes is very efficient to compute. We propose a formulation to learn the hash function and prototypes such that the classification error is minimized.

To make posterior inference feasible, a reparametrization is proposed for the MVG prior, simplifying the complex MVG-based model to an equivalent yet simpler model with independent Gaussian priors on the transformed weights. Consequently, we develop a scalable Bayesian online inference algorithm by adopting the recently proposed probabilistic backpropagation framework.

While there are many important analyses of this estimation problem, the present paper derives convergence rates in other practical settings that are less understood, namely, extensions of traditional Lipschitz smoothness conditions, and common high-dimensional settings with structured data (e.g. manifold data, sparse data).   Various interesting facts, which hold in earlier settings, are shown to extend to these settings. Namely, (1) optimal rates depend only on the smoothness of the ratio f, and not on the densities $f_Q$, $f_P$, supporting the belief that plugging in estimates for $f_Q$, $f_P$ is suboptimal; (2) optimal rates depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data, i.e. this problem -- unlike density estimation -- escapes the curse of dimension.   We further show that near-optimal rates are attainable by estimators tuned from data alone, i.e. with no prior distributional information. This last fact is of special interest in unsupervised settings such as this one, where only oracle rates seem to be known, i.e., rates which assume critical distributional information usually unavailable in practice. },

By using pairwise alignment information to build an undirected graph and initializing the permutation matrices along the edges of its Maximum Spanning Tree, our algorithm successfully avoids bad local optima. Theoretically, with high probability our algorithm guarantees an optimal solution under reasonable noise assumptions. Empirically, our algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods on several benchmark tasks on real datasets.},

This is a parsimonious model that captures a number of interesting problems including context and location aware recommendations, personalized `tag' learning, demand learning with side information, etc. Viewing the matrix we seek to recover and the side information we have as slices of a tensor, we consider the problem of Slice Recovery, which is to recover specific slices of a tensor from noisy observations of the tensor. We provide an efficient algorithm to recover slices of structurally 'simple' tensors given noisy observations of the tensor's entries; our definition of simplicity subsumes low-rank tensors for a variety of definitions of tensor rank. Our algorithm is practical for large datasets and provides a significant performance improvement over state of the art incumbent approaches to tensor recovery. We establish theoretical recovery guarantees that under reasonable assumptions are minimax optimal for slice recovery. These guarantees also imply the first minimax optimal guarantees for recovering tensors of low Tucker rank and general noise. Experiments on data from a music streaming service demonstrate the performance and scalability of our algorithm.},

We fill the gap in the existing literature by deriving the moments of the arc length for a stationary GP with multiple output dimensions. A new method is used to derive the mean of a one-dimensional GP over a finite interval, by considering the distribution of the arc length integrand. This technique is used to derive an approximate distribution over the arc length of a vector valued GP in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by moment matching the distribution. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical derivations.},

Recent works (Alaoui 2014, Musco 2016) show that sampling points with replacement according to their ridge leverage scores (RLS) generates small dictionaries of relevant points with strong spectral approximation guarantees for $K_n$. The drawback of RLS-based methods is that computing exact RLS requires constructing and storing the whole kernel matrix. In this paper, we introduce SQUEAK, a new algorithm for kernel approximation based on RLS sampling that \emph{sequentially} processes the dataset, storing a dictionary which creates accurate kernel matrix approximations with a number of points that only depends on the effective dimension $d_{eff}(\gamma)$ of the dataset. Moreover since all the RLS estimations are efficiently performed using only the small dictionary, SQUEAK never constructs the whole matrix $K_n$, runs in linear time $\widetilde{O}(nd_{eff}(\gamma)^3)$ w.r.t.~$n$, and requires only a single pass over the dataset. We also propose a parallel and distributed version of SQUEAK achieving similar accuracy in as little as $\widetilde{O}(\log(n)d_{eff}(\gamma)^3)$ time.},

Note that $K$ is the $l_0$ norm of the signal. Other existing  1-bit CS algorithms require  the $l_2$ norm of the signal.  In this paper, we develop an estimation procedure for the $l_\alpha$ norm of the signal, where $0<\alpha\leq2$ from binary or multi-bit measurements. We demonstrate that using a  simple closed-form estimator with merely 1-bit information does not result in a significant loss of accuracy if the parameter is chosen appropriately.

Using 2 or more bits  per measurement reduces the variance and  importantly, stabilizes the estimate so that  the  variance is not too sensitive to chosen parameters.},

	 abstract = {In this paper we propose guaranteed spectral methods for learning a broad range of topic models, which generalize the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We overcome the limitation of LDA to incorporate arbitrary topic correlations, by assuming that the hidden topic proportions are drawn from a flexible class of Normalized Infinitely Divisible (NID) distributions. NID distributions are generated by normalizing a family of independent Infinitely Divisible (ID) random variables. The Dirichlet distribution is a special case obtained by normalizing a set of Gamma random variables. We prove that this flexible topic model class can be learnt via spectral methods using only moments up to the third order, with (low order) polynomial sample and computational complexity. The proof is based on a key new technique derived here that allows us to diagonalize the moments of the NID distribution through an efficient procedure that requires evaluating only univariate integrals, despite the fact that we are handling high dimensional multivariate moments. In order to assess the performance of our proposed Latent NID topic model, we use two real datasets of articles collected from New York Times and Pubmed. Our experiments yield improved perplexity on both datasets compared with the baseline.},

This linear scan over labels becomes prohibitive when the number of labels is very large. To alleviate this problem we propose a two step approach where computationally efficient label filters pre-select a small set of candidate labels before the base multiclass or multilabel classifier is applied. The label filters select candidate labels by projecting a test instance on a filtering line, and retaining only the labels that have training instances in the vicinity of this projection.  The filter parameters are learned directly from data by solving a constraint optimization problem, and are independent of the base multilabel classifier. The proposed label filters can be used in conjunction with any multiclass or multilabel classifier that requires a linear scan over the labels, and speed up prediction by orders of magnitude without significant impact on performance.},

	 abstract = {Many machine learning tasks, such as learning with invariance and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, can be characterized as problems of learning from conditional distributions. In such problems, each sample x itself is associated with a conditional distribution $p(z|x)$ represented by samples ${z_i}_{i=1}^M$, and the goal is to learn a function f that links these conditional distributions to target values y. These problems become very challenging when we only have limited samples or in the extreme case only one sample from each conditional distribution. Commonly used approaches either assume that z is independent of x, or require an overwhelmingly large set of samples from each conditional distribution.   To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach which employs a new min-max reformulation of the learning from conditional distribution problem.  With such new reformulation, we only need to deal with the joint distribution p(z,x). We also design an efficient learning algorithm, Embedding-SGD, and establish theoretical sample complexity for such problems. Finally, our numerical experiments, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, show that the proposed approach can significantly improve over existing algorithms.},

This tool allows us to convert step-up or step-down multiple hypothesis testing procedures in the fixed-horizon setting (which includes Benjamini-Hochberg, Holm, and Bonferroni)  into sequential versions that allow the statistician to reject a hypothesis as soon as the sequential p-value reaches a threshold. We show that if the original procedure has a type I error guarantee in a certain family (including FDR and FWER), then the sequential conversion inherits an analogous guarantee. The conversion also allows for allocating samples in a data-dependent way, and we provide simulated experiments demonstrating an increased number of rejections when compared to the fixed-horizon setting.},

This matrix is designed to capture the relevant statistics of the training sequences. What is crucial is that to capture long range dependencies we must consider very large Hankel matrices. Thus the computation of the SVD becomes a critical bottleneck. Our solution finds a subset of rows and columns of the Hankel that realizes a compact and informative Hankel submatrix. The novelty lies in the way that this subset is selected: we exploit a maximal bipartite matching combinatorial algorithm to look for a sub-block with full structural rank, and show how computation of this sub-block can be further improved by exploiting the specific structure of Hankel matrices.},

The k-means objective is non-convex and non-differentiable; we exploit ideas from non-convex gradient-based optimization by providing a novel characterization of the trajectory of the k-means algorithm on its solution space, and circumvent its non-differentiability via geometric insights about the k-means update.},

The high fidelity gradients enable automated learning rate selection and do not require stepsize decay. Big batch methods are thus easily automated and can run with little or no oversight.},

Recently, a convex optimization approach for MSA was proposed based on the concept of atomic norm, which demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods in the quality of alignments. However, the convex program is challenging to solve due to the constraint given by the intersection of two atomic-norm balls, for which the existing algorithm can only handle sequences of length up to 50, with an iteration complexity subject to constants of unknown relation to the natural parameters of MSA. In this work, we propose an accelerated dual decomposition algorithm that exploits entropy regularization to induce closed-form solutions for each atomic-norm-constrained subproblem, giving a single-loop algorithm of iteration complexity linear to the problem size (total length of all sequences). The proposed algorithm gives significantly better alignments than existing methods on sequences of length up to hundreds, where the existing convex programming method fails to converge in one day.},

The instrumental variable (IV) and local causal discovery (LCD) patterns are canonical examples of settings where a closed-form expression exists for the causal effect of one variable on another, given the presence of a third variable. Both rely on faithfulness to infer that the latter only influences the target effect via the cause variable. In reality, it is likely that this assumption only holds approximately and that there will be at least some form of weak interaction. This brings about the paradoxical situation that, in the large-sample limit, no predictions are made, as detecting the weak edge invalidates the setting.  We introduce an alternative approach by replacing strict faithfulness with a prior that reflects the existence of many 'weak' (irrelevant) and 'strong' interactions. We obtain a posterior distribution over the target causal effect estimator which shows that, in many cases, we can still make good estimates. We demonstrate the approach in an application on a simple linear-Gaussian setting, using the MultiNest sampling algorithm, and compare it with established techniques to show our method is robust even when strict faithfulness is violated.},

In this paper, we present first algorithms to compute non-count symmetries in both Boolean-valued and multi-valued domains. Our methods can also find symmetries between multi-valued variables that have different domain cardinalities.  The key insight in the algorithms is that they change the unit of symmetry computation from a variable to a variable-value (VV) pair.  Our experiments find that exploiting these symmetries in MCMC  can obtain substantial computational gains over existing algorithms.},

Despite the intractability of exact MAP inference, approximated methods based on LP relaxations have exhibited superior performance across a wide range of applications. Yet for problems involving large output domains (i.e., the state space for each variable is large), standard LP relaxations can easily give rise to a large number of variables and constraints which are beyond the limit of existing optimization algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an effective MAP inference method for problems with large output domains. The method builds upon alternating minimization of an Augmented Lagrangian that exploits the sparsity of messages through greedy optimization techniques. A key feature of our greedy approach is to introduce variables in an on-demand manner with a pre-built data structure over local factors. This results in a single-loop algorithm of sublinear cost per iteration and O(log(1/epsilon))-type iteration complexity to achieve epsilon sub-optimality. In addition, we introduce a variant of GDMM for binary MAP inference problems with a large number of factors. Empirically, the proposed algorithms demonstrate orders of magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art MAP inference techniques on MAP inference problems including Segmentation, Alignment, Protein Folding, Graph Matching, and Pairwise-Interacted Multilabel Prediction.},

	 abstract = {Greedy algorithms are widely used for problems in machine learning such as feature selection and set function optimization.  Unfortunately, for large datasets, the running time of even greedy algorithms can be quite high.  This is because for each greedy step we need to refit a model or calculate a function using the previously selected choices and the new candidate.   Two algorithms that are faster approximations to the greedy forward selection were introduced recently~[Mirzasoleiman et al., 2013, 2015]. They achieve better performance by exploiting stochastic evaluation and distributed computation respectively. Both algorithms have provable performance guarantees for submodular functions.  In this paper we show that divergent from previously held opinion, submodularity is not required to obtain approximation guarantees for these two algorithms. Specifically, we show that a generalized concept of weak submodularity suffices to give multiplicative approximation guarantees. Our result extends the applicability of these algorithms to a larger class of functions. Furthermore, we show that a bounded submodularity ratio can be used to provide data dependent bounds that can sometimes be tighter also for submodular functions. We empirically validate our work by showing superior performance of fast greedy approximations versus several established baselines on artificial and real datasets. },
