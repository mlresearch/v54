title: Regret Bounds for Lifelong Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in an online setting. Different
  tasks are presented sequentially  and processed by a within-task algorithm. We propose
  a lifelong learning strategy which refines the underlying  data representation used
  by the within-task algorithm, thereby transferring information from one task to
  the next.  We show that when the within-task algorithm comes with some regret bound,
  our strategy inherits this good property.  Our bounds are in expectation for a general
  loss function, and uniform for a convex loss. We discuss applications to dictionary
  learning and finite set of predictors. In the latter case, we improve previous $O(1/\sqrtm)$
  bounds  to $O(1/m)$, where $m$ is the per task sample size.
