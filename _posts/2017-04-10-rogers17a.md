title: A New Class of Private Chi-Square Hypothesis Tests
abstract: In this paper, we develop new test statistics for hypothesis testing over
  differentially private data. These statistics are designed specifically so that
  their asymptotic distributions, after accounting for privacy noise, match the asymptotics
  of the non-private chi-square tests for testing if the multinomial data parameters
  lie in lower dimensional manifolds (examples include goodness-of-fit and independence
  testing). Empirically, these new test statistics outperform prior work, which focused
  on noisy versions of existing statistics.
